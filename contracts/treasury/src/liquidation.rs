//! Automated fee liquidation through a whitelisted AMM (issue #444).
//!
//! Protocol fees and strategy yield accumulate in whatever token they were
//! earned in. Treasury accounting, however, is denominated in a single primary
//! stablecoin, so idle fee tokens have to be swapped. Doing that by hand is an
//! operational burden and a timing risk; `liquidate_fees` lets governance turn
//! a whitelisted token balance into the primary stablecoin in one call.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - **Whitelist first.** Only an admin-approved [`Amm`] may be swapped
//!   through, and the destination stablecoin and the price feed are set by the
//!   admin too. An unconfigured treasury cannot liquidate at all
//!   ([`Error::LiquidationNotConfigured`]).
//! - **Slippage floor from the oracle.** `liquidate_fees` reads the price feed
//!   for `token_in/stable`, derives the expected output, and reduces it by the
//!   caller's tolerance. The AMM must deliver at least that much. The oracle
//!   value is a *floor*, never a settlement price: the AMM's actual output is
//!   what gets booked, and it is cross-checked against the treasury's own
//!   token-balance delta, so a lying AMM cannot be credited for tokens it
//!   never sent (the same untrusted-external-call posture as
//!   [`crate::strategies`]).
//! - **Transferred before the swap.** The treasury moves `amount_in` to the
//!   AMM and only then calls `swap`, mirroring the strategy `deposit` flow.
//! - **One call, one lock.** Every liquidation runs under the treasury's
//!   reentrancy lock, so a hostile AMM cannot re-enter the portfolio or a
//!   second liquidation mid-swap.
//!
//! Prices are integers scaled by [`PRICE_SCALE`]: a price of `p` means one
//! unit of `base` is worth `p / PRICE_SCALE` units of `quote`.
