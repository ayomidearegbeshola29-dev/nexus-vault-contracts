//! Automated governance-token buyback & burn (issue #465).
//!
//! A share of protocol fees is used to market-buy the native governance token
//! on a DEX and burn it, creating deflationary pressure:
//!
//! 1. The admin configures the hook once with [`set_config`]: the fee token to
//!    spend, the governance token to acquire, the DEX router to trade on, the
//!    address the bought tokens are burned at, and a minimum swap size.
//! 2. Anyone (a keeper) may call [`execute`]. It refuses swaps below the
//!    configured minimum ([`Error::BelowBuybackThreshold`]), moves `amount_in`
//!    of the fee token to the router, calls
//!    [`DexRouter::swap`](DexRouter::swap) with a caller-supplied
//!    `min_amount_out` slippage floor, then sends whatever governance tokens
//!    come back to the burn address.
//!
//! # Slippage & sandwich protection
//!
//! The DEX is untrusted. `execute` passes the caller's `min_amount_out`
//! straight to the router *and* re-checks the returned amount against it, so a
//! router that under-fills reverts the whole invocation
//! ([`Error::BuybackSlippageExceeded`]) rather than letting the treasury overpay.
//! Because the burn address is fixed at configuration time it cannot be
//! redirected by the keeper either.
