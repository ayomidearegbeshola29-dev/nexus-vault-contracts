//! Diversified stablecoin yield strategies (issue #466).
//!
//! Idle treasury reserves are split across several **whitelisted** yield
//! protocols (Aave-style lending markets, money markets, …) in proportions
//! governance chooses, so no single protocol's failure, rate freeze, or
//! haircut strands the treasury's float.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - **Whitelist first.** Only an admin-approved address may ever hold
//!   treasury tokens: [`whitelist`] is the gate and every deployment path
//!   re-checks it, so a rogue address cannot be funded by a typo.
//! - **Weights, not amounts.** Governance sets percentages
//!   ([`AllocationConfig::weight_bps`], in basis points, summing to exactly
//!   [`TOTAL_WEIGHT_BPS`]) and the engine derives the amounts. A rebalance is
//!   therefore idempotent with respect to the current balance: the same
//!   weights always describe the same portfolio shape.
//! - **Recall first, deploy second.** [`rebalance`] is a full rotation — every
//!   unit of principal comes home, the resulting balance is re-split by weight,
//!   and only then does the new target go out. Capital is never deployed twice,
//!   and a rebalance is the emergency exit as well as the routine one.
//! - **Booked, never trusted.** A strategy is an untrusted external contract
//!   (the same posture `refund-vault` takes for its yield hook, #415): its
//!   self-reported principal and yield are cross-checked against the treasury's
//!   own token balance, and a strategy that under-pays is rejected with
//!   [`Error::StrategyUnderpaid`] instead of being credited for tokens it
//!   never sent. Every strategy call runs under the reentrancy lock.
//! - **A liquid buffer survives.** [`set_reserve_bps`] keeps a slice of the
//!   balance out of the portfolio so vesting claims and other obligations are
//!   still payable. It defaults to fully liquid, so a freshly initialized
//!   treasury deploys nothing until governance deliberately lowers it.
//!
//! Strategy bookkeeping is stored per address under
//! [`DataKey::Allocation`] and iterated in the order governance supplied, with
//! the order itself kept in [`DataKey::AllocationOrder`].
