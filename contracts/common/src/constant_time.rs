//! Constant-time cryptographic comparison (issue #436).
//!
//! Comparing secret-derived byte strings with `==` or `slice::eq` is a timing
//! oracle: the standard implementations short-circuit at the first differing
//! byte, so the time a comparison takes leaks the length of the shared prefix.
//! An attacker who can measure call latency can recover a token, MAC, or
//! signature one byte at a time.
//!
//! [`constant_time_eq`] compares two byte slices in time that depends only on
//! their *lengths*: it walks every byte of both inputs, accumulates each
//! difference with a bitwise OR, and inspects the accumulator only once, at
//! the very end. There is no early return and no branch on a byte value, and
//! [`core::hint::black_box`] stops the optimizer from rediscovering the
//! short-circuit and undoing the mitigation.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This is a best-effort software mitigation for the guest, not a hardware
//! guarantee. Soroban's gas metering means a caller can already observe
//! operation counts, and cache/timing effects below the guest are outside a
//! contract's control. Use it for the comparisons where a byte-level prefix
//! leak is the threat — MACs, bearer tokens, commitment/digest equality — and
//! keep the surrounding interface from branching on the result where possible.

use core::hint::black_box;

/// Compare `a` and `b` without short-circuiting on the first difference.
///
/// Returns `true` iff the slices have the same length and identical contents.
///
/// Every byte of both inputs is read, folded into a single `u32` accumulator
/// with `|=`, and the accumulator is tested exactly once at the end. A length
/// difference is folded in as a non-zero seed before the loop, so it too is
/// detected without a conditional early exit.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use nexus-vault_common::constant_time::constant_time_eq;
///
/// assert!(constant_time_eq(b"same", b"same"));
/// assert!(!constant_time_eq(b"same", b"sAmE"));
/// assert!(!constant_time_eq(b"same", b"same!"));

    // the same accumulation rather than being a separate early return.
