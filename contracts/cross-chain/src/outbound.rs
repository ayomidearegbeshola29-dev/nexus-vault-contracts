//! Outbound withdrawal bridging requests for cross-chain settlement (issue #456).

//! Allows merchants and users to withdraw their settled Soroban balances to an
//! EVM destination chain. The contract burns the wrapped asset on Soroban and
//! emits a standardized cross-chain bridging event payload for external relayers
//! to process and mint/unlock on the destination EVM network.
