//! Canonical, indexer-facing event schema for `ReceiptAnchor` (issue #379).
//!
//! Every receipt-scoped event is published under one topic tuple —
//! `(receipt, action, anchor_id)` — so an indexer subscribes to a single topic
//! and routes on the `action` symbol instead of maintaining a per-event topic
//! table (Horizon, Mercury and SubQuery all filter on topic tuples).
//!
//! The data map is a typed [`AnchorPayload`] / [`PrunePayload`] struct encoded
//! with its field names as keys. It always leads with `schema_version` and
//! `timestamp`, so a reader can reject payloads it cannot parse and can order
//! receipt logs by wall-clock time as well as by ledger.
//!
//! Admin and factory events (`initialized_event`, `shard_created_event`,
//! `rate_limit_updated_event`, `anchor_interval_updated_event`, the admin
//! transfer pair) are not receipt logs and keep their own documented shapes in
//! [`docs/EVENTS.md`](../../../docs/EVENTS.md).
