//! Batched Ed25519 signature verification (issue #471).
//!
//! Multi-party channels collect one approving signature per participant over
//! one canonical close envelope. Verifying them at each call site spreads the
//! pairing and the length checks across the codebase, and every new call site
//! is another chance to pair a public key with the wrong signature or skip a
//! participant entirely. [`verify_signatures`] centralises that: callers hand
//! over one flat `signers` array and one flat `signatures` array, which must
//! line up 1:1, and the helper checks every entry against the same payload in
//! a single pass.
//!
//! # Why there is no single "batch" host call
//!
//! This runtime exposes per-signature `ed25519_verify`; it has no batched
//! Ed25519 host function (see `soroban_sdk::crypto::Crypto` for the complete
//! surface — `sha256`, `ed25519_verify`, the secp recover/verify pairs, and
//! the BLS/BN curve helpers). "One host call for the whole batch" is therefore
//! not expressible here, and this module does not pretend otherwise. What a
//! batch *can* pin down is the aggregation: the arrays are length-checked
//! against each other before the host is touched, and the payload is fixed
//! once for the batch, so a caller cannot mis-pair keys with signatures or
//! verify a participant against a different message than the others.
//!
//! # Rejection semantics
//!
//! `ed25519_verify` **traps** on an invalid signature — it returns no boolean.
//! A forged or malformed signature therefore aborts the whole invocation
//! before any state is committed, which is the correct rejection behaviour for
//! a settlement envelope: the bad state is never recorded. The only
//! recoverable failure is a length mismatch, which is a caller bug rather than
//! a forged proof, and is reported as [`Error::InvalidSignature`] without
//! touching the host.
