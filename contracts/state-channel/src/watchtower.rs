//! Watchtower reward bounties for channel defense (issue #459).
//!
//! A participant who may be forced offline can attach a token bounty to their
//! channel: if a **watchtower** successfully files a newer signed state on
//! their behalf (counter-evidence against a stale close), a fraction of the
//! balance that defense recovers is paid to that watchtower when the dispute
//! settles.
//!
//! # Who posts the bounty
//!
//! The bounty is configured by the channel's **receiver** — the party whose
//! balance a successful counter-proof protects. `set_watchtower_bounty`
//! requires the receiver's authorization and caps the reward at
//! [`MAX_REWARD_BPS`] (20%) of the recovered balance, so a bounty can never
//! consume the entire payout.
//!
//! # Who earns it
//!
//! The watchtower is the address that authorized the accepted counter-evidence
//! (`watchtower_counter_evidence`). Recording it is one-shot: once a dispute
//! settles, [`take_reward`] clears the stored watchtower, so a later dispute on
//! the same channel must name a new defender. The reward is carved out of the
//! receiver's payout, never out of the sender's refund, so the escrow still
//! balances exactly.
