//! Streaming micro-disbursement schedules (issue #410).
//!
//! A buyer escrows a `deposit` in this contract and it streams linearly to
//! the merchant at `rate_per_ledger` between `start_ledger` and
//! `stop_ledger` (e.g. $1/minute of API or SaaS consumption). At any ledger
//! the amount streamed so far is
//!
//! ```text
//! min(deposit, (current_ledger - start_ledger) * rate_per_ledger)
//! ```
//!
//! with the clock clamped to `[start_ledger, stop_ledger]` and frozen while
//! the stream is paused. The merchant's claimable balance is the streamed
//! amount less what has already been claimed.
//!
//! - [`StreamVault::claim_stream`] is permissionless: it can only ever pay
//!   the merchant, so a keeper may call it. Once the stop ledger is reached
//!   the claim pays out the full deposit and the stream closes automatically
//!   (its record is removed).
//! - The buyer may [`StreamVault::pause_stream`] /
//!   [`StreamVault::resume_stream`] at any time. Resuming shifts the schedule
//!   forward by the paused duration, so the buyer is never charged for
//!   paused ledgers.
//! - The buyer may [`StreamVault::cancel_stream`] at any time: the merchant
//!   receives what has streamed but not been claimed, and the unspent
//!   principal is returned to the buyer.
//!
//! # Why a separate contract
//!
//! Streaming was first built into `RefundVault`, but the vault is already
//! close to Soroban's 128 KiB contract size limit and the extra code pushed
//! it over. A dedicated contract also keeps buyer escrow structurally
//! separate from the merchant's refund float: this contract's balance is
//! exactly the unclaimed principal of its open streams, so no refund,
//! withdrawal or yield deployment can ever touch it.
//!
//! One instance serves one merchant and one token, mirroring `RefundVault`.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Every entry point writes its state before making a token transfer
//! (checks-effects-interactions), so a re-entrant call from a non-standard
//! token observes the post-update state.
