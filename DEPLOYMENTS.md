# Deployments

Every Accensa contract deployment is recorded here with its contract ID and
provenance, so anyone can verify the deployment independently without trusting
this repository.

Machine-readable values live in [`deployments/<network>.env`](deployments/) and
are produced by [`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh).

## Testnet

Deployed 2026-07-22 with `soroban-sdk` 27.0.0, built for `wasm32v1-none`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **These addresses run `0.1.0`. `main` is at `0.2.0`.**
>
> Soroban deployment mints a new contract ID, so redeploying would invalidate every
> published address — including the ones the public verifier at
> <https://nexus-vault-dashboard.vercel.app/verify> reads live. `0.2.0` is therefore a
> source release and these contracts were deliberately left in place.
>
> What that means in practice: `prune_batches`, `get_batch_count`,
> `extend_batch_ttl`, `pause`, `unpause` and `extend_refund_ttl` **do not exist at
> these addresses**, and the events they emit here are still `0.1.0`'s
> `("anchored", batch_id)` and `("refunded", payment_ref)` rather than the
> `anchor_event` / `refund_event` topics documented in
> [`docs/EVENTS.md`](docs/EVENTS.md). An indexer pointed at these addresses must
> use the old topics. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and
> [#59](https://github.com/nexus-vault/nexus-vault-contracts/issues/59).

### Verifying the live testnet deployment yourself

Batch #1 is anchored on-chain over four demo receipts.  Its Merkle root was
computed off-chain by the TypeScript SDK (`packages/sdk` in
[`nexus-vault-app`](https://github.com/nexus-vault/nexus-vault-app)) and verified on-chain
by `ReceiptAnchor.verify_receipt` — the two implementations agree on the same
sorted-pair SHA-256 convention.

Read the anchored batch:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CBHRJU7CF4XIFRNDITFHNQHABKBMFM2FYFHLGWN3JGSFYYCDSMDAWPRV \
  --network testnet --source <your-identity> \
  -- get_batch --batch_id 1
```

Verify a receipt that is in the batch — returns `true`:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CBHRJU7CF4XIFRNDITFHNQHABKBMFM2FYFHLGWN3JGSFYYCDSMDAWPRV \
  --network testnet --source <your-identity> \
  -- verify_receipt --batch_id 1 \
  --leaf c476fc0553303ec4275bd4cb50ab7fa8182e343dbc4c721d7e2076fd77a5b56c \
  --proof '["7ca64ee60e2b975f59f2a1f1cc1526d5b001a5c29f70291f316ba1c012a01bd1","1733fad16ada0c23d8cdaff52bea66bea308dddddcb79348842acef0065c9615"]'
```

Verify a forged receipt against the same proof — returns `false`:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CBHRJU7CF4XIFRNDITFHNQHABKBMFM2FYFHLGWN3JGSFYYCDSMDAWPRV \
  --network testnet --source <your-identity> \
  -- verify_receipt --batch_id 1 \
  --leaf 16b138aabc889c21114436424e13132bd8928d2c21b4ac5a9ac5198104efb42c \
  --proof '["7ca64ee60e2b975f59f2a1f1cc1526d5b001a5c29f70291f316ba1c012a01bd1","1733fad16ada0c23d8cdaff52bea66bea308dddddcb79348842acef0065c9615"]'
```

Both are read-only simulations and cost nothing to run.

## Using a multisig contract account as admin

`initialize` takes a single `Address` as the merchant/admin, and on Soroban that
address does not have to be a keypair. Point it at a **contract account** that
implements `__check_auth` (this repo ships `contracts/multisig-account`, a
threshold account) and every privileged call — `pause`, `unpause`,
`set_refund_window`, `refund`, `withdraw`, `anchor_batch`, `prune_batches` —
requires the account's threshold of signers, with **no change to the vault or
anchor**. See [`docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md#1-the-admin-merchant)
for what this means for key-compromise risk; the mechanism is exercised by
tests in `contracts/refund-vault/tests/multisig_admin_vault.rs` and
`contracts/receipt-anchor/tests/multisig_admin_anchor.rs`.

### Worked example: a 2-of-3 multisig merchant

1. **Deploy the account contract** with its three signers and threshold 2. The
   constructor takes `(signers, threshold)`:

   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <multisig-wasm-hash> --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/multisig_account.wasm \
     --network testnet --source <deployer> \
     -- __constructor \
     --signers '["GDEVELOPER1...","GDEVELOPER2...","GDEVELOPER3..."]' \
     --threshold 2
   ```

   Note the deployed account's contract ID — that is your merchant address:

   ```bash
   MULTISIG=<account-contract-id>
   ```

2. **Initialize the vault with the account as merchant** (the anchor is
exactly the same: `ReceiptAnchor.initialize` with the same account):

   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <refund-vault-id> --source <deployer> \
     --network testnet \
     -- initialize \
     --merchant $MULTISIG \
     --token CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC \
     --refund_window_ledgers 17280
   ```

3. **Privileged calls now need the signers.** Wallet tooling builds the
   `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` with the account's address in
   `AddressWithDelegates` credentials and the signers attached as delegated
   signers — exactly what the tests in `multisig_admin_vault.rs` construct by
   hand. A transaction carrying only one signer is rejected by the account's
   `__check_auth` before the vault code runs.

## Redeploying

```bash
./deploy.sh                          # testnet (default), identity "deployer"
NETWORK=futurenet ./deploy.sh        # another network
TOKEN=<usdc-sac-id> ./deploy.sh      # settle refunds in USDC instead of XLM

# Pubnet — requires clean working tree, main branch, and explicit confirmation:
NETWORK=pubnet TOKEN=<mainnet-usdc-sac-id> ./deploy.sh
```

The script writes `deployments/<network>.env`.  Commit that file so the record
stays reproducible.
